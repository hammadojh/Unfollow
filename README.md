# Unfollow

A simple interaction for the Follow/Unfollow concept. Somethimes you don't want to unfollow a person but you want to like five him a warning so that if he publishes the same content again you will unfollow him/her. This interaction proposes a solution for that. A private warning icon appears near the following button that lets you remember that you have gave this account a warning before.

This can also reduce the number of unfollows for twitter (or any other social media platform).
